                    Rabindranath Tagore, often called Gurudev, was one of the greatest literary and cultural figures not only in India but across the world. Born on 7th May 1861 in Calcutta (now Kolkata), Tagore was a poet, philosopher, musician, artist, and educationist whose contributions left a profound impact on literature, art, and national identity. He was the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913 for his collection of poems Gitanjali.

                    Tagore was born into a prominent Bengali family known for its cultural and intellectual pursuits. Although he did not receive a conventional school education, he was exposed to literature, music, and art at home. Later, he briefly studied law in England but soon returned to India, choosing instead to follow his passion for literature and creativity.
